1. Always Follow the Golden Rule: Always treat others the same way you wish to be treated.
- Be Friendly & Polite.
- Never speak sarcastically or behave passive-aggressively.
- Under-promise and over-deliver.
- - Always follow-through on your promises. Do what you said you would do, exactly how you said you would do it.
- - if you are unable to deliver on your promises, maintain good communication with the client and provide good reasons for the delay.
2. Always leave the client better and happier than when you found them.
3. Train your voice to always sound upbeat and friendly. As far as the customer knows, everything in your life is great!
4. Speak clearly and with unambiguous language.
  - e.g. using the word "correct" to respond to a question is more clear than saying "right".
  - When saying phone numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, website URLs, etc be sure to speak them more slowly than your regular speech.
5. Always look for reasons to give clients a freebie. This works especially well at building good-will when they think you're doing them a favor.
  - **the law of reciprocation**
  - Please use discretion.
6. Your co-workers are also clients. Sometimes they need something that only you can provide. Treat them like a customer.
