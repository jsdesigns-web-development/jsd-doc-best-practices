2. Double-check all links are correct, including contact info like email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses and social media accounts.
3. Always create a favicon. (see `creating-favicons.md`)
4. Always create a sitemap. A sitemap looks like every other page of the website, except the body contains a list of links to the pages on the website.
5. Always include the Google Analytics script.
6. If social media links are going unused, be sure to comment them out "<\!-- this is an HTML comment -->"
7. Social Media <meta\> tags should always be included on ever page (see `html-head.md`)
8. All filenames must be lowercase and descriptive. For example, a page talking about "General Liability Insurance" should have the file name `general-liability-insurance.html`
